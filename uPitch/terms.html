  We  reserve the right, at our discretion, to change the Terms on a going-forward  basis at any time. Please check the Terms periodically for changes. In the  event that a change to the Terms materially modifies your rights or  obligations, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such change. We  may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within the Service, by sending an  email to any address you may have used to register for an Account, or through  other similar mechanisms.

  In  the interest of resolving disputes between you and us in the most expedient and  cost effective manner, you and we agree that any and all disputes arising in  connection with the Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration  is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator  instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court,  and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the  same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate  disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating  to any aspect of the Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation  or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or  after the termination of the Terms.

Notice shall be deemed given 24 hours after email is sent, unless the sending  party is notified that the email address is invalid. Alternatively, Company may  give you notice by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt  requested, to the address provided to Company. In such case, notice shall be  deemed given three days after the date of mailing.<br>
  <strong><u>24.  ASSIGNMENT:</u></strong><br>
  You  will not assign any rights or delegate any obligations under these Terms, in  whole or in part, by operation of law, merger, or otherwise, without obtaining  our prior written consent, which may be withheld in our sole discretion. We may  assign our rights and delegate any of our obligations under these Terms, in  whole or in part, without your consent. Any assignment or delegation in  violation of the foregoing will be null and void. These Terms will be binding  and inure to the benefit of each party&rsquo;s permitted successors and assigns.<br>
  <strong><u>25. WAIVER  AND SEVERABILITY:</u></strong><br>
  Our  failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a  waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these  Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be  limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary to comply with applicable  law, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and  effect.<br>
  <strong><u>26. RELEASE:</u></strong><br>
  You  hereby release the Company Parties and their successors from claims, demands,  any and all losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including  personal injuries, death, and property damage, that is either directly or  indirectly related to or arises from your use of the Company Properties,  including but not limited to, any interactions with or conduct of members and other  Users or third-party websites of any kind arising in connection with or as a  result of the Terms or your use of the Company Properties. <br>
